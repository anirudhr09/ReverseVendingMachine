A socially impactful project that rewards users for recycling bottles and cans through an intelligent reverse vending system.

## 🚀 Overview
The Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) uses a **YOLOv5 deep learning model** to detect recyclable objects and classify them accurately. A companion **React mobile application** allows users to scan and deposit items, earn reward points, and track their recycling history.  
Points are securely transferred using a **custom-built QR hasher** and a **cryptographic ciphering algorithm**, ensuring safe, offline-compatible transactions.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **YOLOv5** – Object detection and classification  
- **React** – Frontend mobile app  
- **Python / Flask** – Model serving backend  
- **Custom QR Hasher** – Secure point transfer  
- **Cryptographic Ciphers** – Data encryption  

## ✨ Features
- Real-time object detection and recognition  
- QR-based reward system with cryptographic security  
- Interactive React-based mobile interface  
- Scalable backend for reward point management  
- Environmentally conscious project with social relevance  

## 🏆 Achievements
- Recognized at multiple **hackathons and symposiums** for innovation and social relevance.  
- Implemented end-to-end encryption for secure QR-based reward distribution.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Integrate blockchain-based point tracking.  
- Deploy YOLOv5 model on edge devices for faster response.
